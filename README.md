# Void Serpent

**Development on this project is currently paused**

You can find complete builds of the game on my [itch.io](https://b1nary-b0b.itch.io/void-serpent).

*Please note this game is incomplete and in the very early stages. It will likely still have game breaking bugs.

If you would like to follow the development of this game you can see my devlogs on [Bit Lab](https://bit-lab.vercel.app/), sometime soon on itch.io and possibly other platforms in the future. Any comments or feedback is always appreciated, let me know what you enjoyed, what you hated, what you'd like to see added.
